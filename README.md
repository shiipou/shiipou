### - *`/bin/sh -c whoami`*

I'm **[Shiishii](https://github.com/shiipou/shiipou)**. I'm a 25 year old `Ninja` who always work on too big projects, but I want them to succeed !

I'm a professional software developer since 2018, but I've made my first own retro game in 2009. that my real first development project.

I'm a VR enthusiast, I think it can really change the gaming if company and user take the risk to go on it. 

My main competances was in Sys-Admin and bakcend development. But I do website in flutter and Android/iOS application too.

My mains project are in V but sometimes I do Dart (and Flutter), Go, TypeScript (Deno and Node), Java (Springboot or not), C#, bash, and C/C++.

I provide for free the Nocturlab Federated Instances ([PeerTube](https://tube.nocturlab.fr), [NextCloud](https://cloud.nocturlab.fr), [Matrix](https://talk.nocturlab.fr), ...)
