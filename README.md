Hi! I'm [Shiishii](https://github.com/shiipou), a 29-year-old ninja constantly engaged in ambitious and innovative projects.

My journey as a software developer officially began in 2018, but my real adventure in development started much earlier, in 2009, when I created my first retro game. Since then, I've been passionate about technology and always looking to push the boundaries of what's possible.  

As a VR (Virtual Reality) enthusiast, I firmly believe that VR has the potential to revolutionize the world of video games, as long as companies and users dare to venture into it.

My expertise covers a wide range of skills, from system administration and backend development to the creation of Flutter Apps, Websites and Android Applications.

My mains project are in V but sometimes I do Dart (and Flutter), Go, TypeScript (Deno and Node), Java (Springboot or not), C#, bash, and C/C++.
